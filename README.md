DOGEinfo
========
DOGEinfo is an extesion made to help all of the dogecoin miners out there to know important details about DOGEcoin. It currently displays only the dogecoin value to US Dollars, the current block height, the current block hash, and the network difficulty.

If you feel that the work I made was awesome, and you're willing to tip me, feel free to do so at: DTZhSeYdSEE63A256R5bKoMYvKcifBjgZx


Thanks to the awesome people at AwesomeHash! Without them, I wouldn't even be able to make the extension!
